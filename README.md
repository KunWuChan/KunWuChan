I am Kunwu.Chan, a Linux kernel developer. <br>
## Hobbies
Hiking:
- I have traveled from south to north. When I am bored, I like to go to the mountains alone. Heavy camping and drinking tea by the river are all OK <br>
- I went to Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan in 2023, saw the narrowest part of the Yangtze River. Along the river, the majestic Haba Snow Mountain stands to the left, while the splendid Thirteen Peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain can be admired to the right, with the relentless rush of the Jinsha River flowing beneath. When I climbed the 168-meter ladder using my hands and feet, I felt that my fear of heights was improved a little. The profile picture I’m using now was taken on the mountain on the Tiger Leaping Gorge Highway. I was facing the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain.
- Professional ability: "Primary Mountain Outdoor Instructor" of China Mountaineering Association, "Level 3 Mountain Outdoor Athlete" of China Mountaineering Association, and Mountain Eagle One-Star Outdoor Leader<br>

Cycling:<br>
- In summer and autumn, I like to ride shared bicycles from Changsha to Xiangtan and back<br>

A lover of Ming Dynasty historical novels<br>

<br>Broad-ranging, always maintaining curiosity and desire to explore technology<br>
In the past two years, I have been exploring emerging and booming fields such as programmable scheduling, eBPF, and riscv in my spare time
<br>In the past ten years, the kernel has involved linux CPU scheduling, virtualization, cgroup, memory security and other fields<br>
Stay hungry in kernel technology, take one step at a time, and work hard for a long time
